    If enabled, Related Post tools will show up on your site <em>after</em> AddThis has crawled your site and put together a list of items to recommend. It can take up to 24 hours for AddThis to crawl your site <em>after</em> adding AddThis tools onto a live site. If you are still having issues seeing related post tools 24 hours after adding AddThis tool onto a live site you can reach out to the AddThis Support team at <a href="mailto:help@addthis.com">help@addthis.com</a>
